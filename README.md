# drakespec

__drakespec__ is an _open specification_ that describes a domain-specific
language for declaratively defining CI/CD pipelines.

All manner of open source and commercial CI/CD platforms and related tools are
permitted and encouraged to adopt support for this specification.

Together, we will usher in a new era of pipeline portability!

## THIS SPEC IS HIGHLY VOLATILE!

This specification is currently under heavy development. Implementors should
be warned that breaking changes to this specification are likely at any point
up until its eventual 1.0 release.
