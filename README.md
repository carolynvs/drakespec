# drakespec

The __drakespec__ is an _open specification_ that describes:

1. A domain-specific language for declaratively defining CI/CD pipelines

1. Runtime requirements for CI/CD platforms that execute those pipelines

Open source and commercial CI/CD platforms (and related tools) are both
permitted and encouraged to adopt support for this specification.

Together, we will usher in a new era of pipeline portability!

## THIS SPEC IS HIGHLY VOLATILE!

This specification is currently under heavy development. Adopters should be
warned that breaking changes to this specification are likely at any point up
until its eventual 1.0 release.
